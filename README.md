# Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) Blueprints

Welcome to AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) Blueprints!

This project contains a collection of AFT customization patterns to demonstrate how to implement core service architectures in a green field Control Tower landing zone, that can be used by AWS customers, partners, and internal AWS teams.

## Introducing AFT Blueprints

The AFT Blueprints project provides a set of pre-defined architectural patterns that can be easily deployed using AWS Control Tower and the Account Factory for Terraform (AFT). These patterns serve as a blueprint for a comprehensive landing zone, enabling users to kickstart their cloud journey with a robust and secure foundation. For now, the project has made available architectures for Network and DNS, Centralized Backup, Identity Management and security services on AWS.

At the heart of the AFT Blueprints project is the goal of empowering AWS customers to accelerate their cloud transformation by leveraging a proven and highly automated approach. By proving these predefined patterns, organizations can learn how to reduce the time and effort required to establish a cloud-ready environment right at the start of their journey.

## Things to keep in mind

- The code in this repository is provided as an example only, and is not intended for production use. However, users are free to modify the patterns locally after cloning the repository, in order to suit their own requirements.
- The patterns provided in this project are not meant to be directly consumed and used as-is, like a module. They are intended as sample code to be referenced by the corresponding AFT repository.
- The AFT Blueprints project does not aim to teach users the recommended practices for working with Terraform. It also does not provide guidance on how users should structure their own Terraform projects.
- The AFT Blueprints is maintained by a mixed team of AWS internal staff, including Professional Services Consultants and Solution Architects. This project is not part of an official AWS service and support is provided on a best-effort basis.
